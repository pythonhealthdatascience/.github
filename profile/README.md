## STARS Framework

The STARS framework is a set of open practices, tools and learning materials to produce enhanced versions of research artefacts that intend to increase accessibility for others to (re)use, adapt and build on work.

Essential components of STARS framework (shaded in green below):
* Open license
* Dependency management
* Model created using free and open-source software (FOSS)
* Minimum documentation
* Research artefact meta data (ORCID ID + citation information)
* Remote code repository
* Open science archive

Optional components of STARS framework (shaded in blue below):
* Enhanced documentation
* Documentation hosting
* Online coding environment
* Model interface
* Web app hosting

## Repositories

Several repositories are related to our recent paper '[Towards sharing tools and artefacts for reusable simulations in healthcare](https://doi.org/10.1080/17477778.2024.2347882)', which includes three examples of the implemented STARS framework in Python:
| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-treat-sim](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-sim) | STARS paper example 1. Implements essential components + annotated notebook to run code executable online with Binder |
| [stars-simpy-example-docs](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-example-docs)<br><br>[stars-streamlit-example](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-streamlit-example) | STARS paper example 2. Fully implements essential + optional components including enhanced documentation hosted online and web app |
| [stars-ciw-example](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-ciw-example) | STARS paper example 3. Fully implements essential + optional components, but with different licence, documentation publishing software, web app framework and web app hosting |

Subsequently, we have been developing similar examples in R, as well as looking at webassembly:
| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-treat-simmer](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-simmer) | R simmer implementation of treatment simulation model |
| [stars-shiny-simmer](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-shiny-simmer) | Template for shiny interface to simmer DES model |
| [stars-stlite-example](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-stlite-example) | stlite template for SimPy models |
| [stars-simpy-jupterlite](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-jupterlite) | JupyterLite template for SimPy models |

As part of STARS, we are assessing the reproducibility of six published simualation models, with related repositories as follows:
| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-reproduction-protocol](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars_reproduction_protocol) | Latex files for reproduction protocol |
| [stars-reproduce-allen-2020](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-reproduce-allen-2020) |Test run of reproducibility protocol on Allen et al. 2020 |
| [stars-reproduction-template](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars_reproduction_template) | Template for assessment of computational reproducibility |

Other repositories are:
| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-publications](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-publications) | List of all STARS publications |
| [stars-logo](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-logo) | SVG and PNG files with logo |
| [stress_update](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stress_update) | A review and update of the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies guidelines for DES, SD, and ABS. |
