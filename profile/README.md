## The STARS Framework

Several repositories are related to our recent paper '[Towards sharing tools and artefacts for reusable simulations in healthcare](https://doi.org/10.1080/17477778.2024.2347882)', which includes three examples of the implemented STARS framework in Python:

| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-treat-sim](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-sim) | STARS paper example 1. Implements essential components + annotated notebook to run code executable online with Binder |
| [stars-simpy-example-docs](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-example-docs)<br><br>[stars-streamlit-example](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-streamlit-example) | STARS paper example 2. Fully implements essential + optional components including enhanced documentation hosted online and web app |
| [stars-ciw-example](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-ciw-example) | STARS paper example 3. Fully implements essential + optional components, but with different licence, documentation publishing software, web app framework and web app hosting |

Subsequently, we have been developing similar examples in R, as well as looking at webassembly:

| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [stars-treat-simmer](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-simmer) | R simmer implementation of treatment simulation model |

| [stars-simpy-jupterlite](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-jupterlite) | JupyterLite template for SimPy models |

## Generating DES models using LLMS

| Repositories | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [llm_simpy](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy) | Code for exploring the ability of LLMs to generate SimPy models and streamlit interfaces. |
| [llm_simpy_models](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy_models) | The SimPy models and apps generated by LLMs, deployed as a single app. |

## Computational reproducibility of published DES models

As part of STARS, we haved assessed the reproducibility of published simualation models, as described in '[On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13137)'.
